# Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic arcade game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.


## Introduction
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where players control a snake on the screen. The objective is to navigate the snake around the screen, eating food represented by orange circles, and growing longer with each piece of food consumed. The game continues until the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or with itself, ending the game.

## Features
1. Intuitive Controls: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
2. Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you consume food and grow longer.
3. Game Over Message: Receive instant feedback with a "Game Over" message when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
4. Random Food Generation: Food items appear randomly on the screen, adding an element of unpredictability to the gameplay.
